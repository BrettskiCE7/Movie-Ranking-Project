<h1>The Best Movies According to Brett</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    Second on the Batman Dark Knight Trilogy and gives a<br />
    stunning performance on the chaotic mind of the Joker.<br />
</p>
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>A pixar animated film based on the importance of family</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>
    A movie with a unique cell shaded art style based on multipler<br />
    versions of our favourite web slinging hero.<br />
</p>
<h3>Baseketball</h3>
<p>
    A comedy from the minds that gave us South Park, that takes a<br />
    combined twist on baseball and basketball.<br />
</p>
<h3>Beverlly Hills Cop</h3>
<p>
    A late 80s action cop film that oozes charm in my opinion,<br />
    when asked about 70s-90s films this comes to mind.<br />
